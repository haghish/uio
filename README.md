This is a repository for my on-going academic projects (anything from lectures/presentations to papers) produced at Department of Psychology, University of Oslo. This is all work in progress, which I have registered at Open Science Framework and will work on here. 

Why bothering with making my on-going work public? It's yet another attempt for both promoting research transparency as well as collaboration. 

On-going papers
---------------

I am currently working on two papers related to imputing highly missing ordinal variables and using machine-learning for predicting suicide attempts. For the latter, I'm mainly interested in utilizing Stack Ensemble algorithms for improving ML models. Here are the titles and you can brows through my drafts. If you have any comments, ideas, etc... please feel free to write me at __haghish [at-sign] uio [dot-sign] no__. 

1. Imputing Highly Missing Likert Variables in Large Survey Datasets
2. Predicting Suicide Attempts Among Norwegian Adolescents Using Nation-Wide Cross-Sectional Data
